            <p class="first-paragraph">Lionel Messi won his seventh La Liga golden boot - and his fourth in a row -
                after scoring twice in
                Barcelona's win over Alaves on the final day.The Barca captain finished on 25 goals, four clear of Real
                Madrid striker Karim Benzema.The game was not of importance as Real clinched the La Liga title on
                Thursday.Messi rounded the keeper to make it 2-0 and swept in a fifth - with teenager Ansu Fati, Luis
                Suarez and Nelson Semedo scoring the other goals.Riqui Puig, Messi and Arturo Vidal all hit the woodwork
                before Fati opened the scoring.This is the first time La Liga's top scorer has managed fewer than 30
                goals since Mallorca's Daniel Guiza 12 years ago.Barca, who only named five out of a possible 12
                substitutes, host Napoli in the Champions League last-16 second leg on 8 August, having drawn 1-1 in
                Italy.</p>

                <p class="last-class">Argentina suffered an ignominious 3-1 defeat to Venezuela in March at Atletico
                    Madrid's Wanda
                    Metropolitano Stadium, thousands of miles from home for both sides. About 20,000 people showed up to
                    watch the game, and it was only the second time in 24 attempts that Venezuela had defeated the
                    two-time FIFA World Cup winners..</p>

                <p class="last-class">Messi has scored more hat tricks than any other player in LaLiga history. His most
                    recent, in a 5-2
                    win over Mallorca on December 7, 2019, was his 35th, and helped him to overtake Cristiano Ronaldo
                    (34)..</p>
